Post.create!(id: 4, author: "Paul Darragh", top_card: false, title: 'Alumni Spotlight - Tom Davis', content: '<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I had an e-mail conversation last week with Tall Paul Darragh; he asked if I&rsquo;d write a few lines about what I&rsquo;ve been doing since my years at RIT and Gamma Nu. I agreed, so here are more than a few lines.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">First, a little about my time at RIT/PKT/Gamma Nu&hellip; my degree is in Electrical Engineering. I was in the spring 1967 pledge class, my sophomore year, with Denny Franklin, Bryan Johnson, Bob LaRose, Mike Ogata and others. I recall that our pledge class fundraiser was the rental of a soft drink vending machine, from which we dispensed beer, naturally. We made a small fortune. In those days the drinking age was 18, so this was only a little bit illegal. Jeff Gregory was our Chapter president; other influential brothers at the time were Gary Proud (GP) (of course), Skip Van Wert, Jim Hopkins, Steve Van Rees, Joe Murphy, Bart Liberatore, Frank D&rsquo;Amico (my big brother and classmate), and a host of others. We were still at the &lsquo;old campus&rsquo; in downtown Rochester, in the &lsquo;old house&rsquo; on Plymouth Avenue. We moved to the new campus a year later, at the end of the 1968 spring quarter. I served as chapter treasurer for a year, then as president in 1969/70. It was quite an experience, and the chapter grew significantly in numbers and accomplishments. Our chapter advisors included Frank Benz, Dick Gajewski, and Stan McKenzie. I coop-ed at Bausch &amp; Lomb in Rochester for the entire program and graduated from RIT in 1970.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">After graduation, I started working for GE as a Field Engineer. I moved into supervisory, then management roles in engineering services and project management, over the course of my 37 years with GE. Most of my career was spent in the greater Philadelphia area, with a short stint in Boston. Our business was primarily involved in installing, commissioning and servicing major electrical equipment at large industrial and utility clients. Some of us described it as &lsquo;great big stuff that went hummmm&hellip;&rdquo; Our equipment rolled steel, made paper, propelled ships, generated and distributed electrical power, and automated all those processes. I found it fascinating to see all these different client businesses up close and in production.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I met my future wife Leslie at the sundial just outside the &lsquo;new&rsquo; fraternity house in late 1969; we were married in 1971. Almost 44 years later, we&rsquo;re still married (to each other!!), have raised three grown children, have the world&rsquo;s two smartest grandsons, and about 4 years ago moved into an &lsquo;active adult&rsquo; community, near Valley Forge, just northwest of Philadelphia. I&rsquo;ve been having a very rewarding retirement for the past 8 years. I still enjoy a poor round of golf a couple times a week, a good vodka martini a couple times a week (at least); we&rsquo;re both active in our community, and our churches, and are still enjoying what many would call excellent health. Couldn&rsquo;t ask for much more!!</span></span></p>')

We had a great rush turn out with how cold it has been outside.</span>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Though one exciting thing about this new class of 11 is that we have another legacy of Phi Kappa Tau. This Legacy is a local legacy from one of our Brothers, Danny Abdeen. Dannys little brother,Cody Abdeen, rushed last fall semester and is officially accepting his bid this semester.</span>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Thanks to everyone who helped with spring recruitment.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Paul Darragh</span></em></p> <p><em><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Spring 12</span></em></p>')

Post.create!(id: 7, author: "Paul Darragh", top_card: false, title: 'Leadership Academy 2014', content: '<p>While in Ohio, Bryan and I had the honor to visit Alpha Chapter at the University of Miami. Although we could not go inside, just seeing it along with the executive offices was amazing. This year two of our chapter''s members, Bryan Harper and myself, attended National Leadership Academy at Camp Kern in Ohio. This proved to be a very substantial experience for both of us. Although I cannot totally speak for Bryan, I think that he would agree with me that it was a life changing experience. From the second you walk through the main doors you feel like you belong. There is no initial hesitation. We were all Phi Taus and that proved to be an obvious instant connection. Every one of us got along and we shared stories for hours from our home chapters. The academy had four days scheduled out and focused the three main days on learning, leading and serving. The workshops provoked thought about all aspects of our fraternity and how we can change it for the future. Bryan and I both come back with many ideas and ways in which we believe that we may be able to help improve Gamma Nu moving forward. We look forward to sharing them with everyone</p> <p>Mark Eddy Spring 14</p>')
