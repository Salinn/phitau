          <p>We pride ourselves on the fact that we are different. That is what holds us together.
            There is no single characteristic that makes us Phi Taus. You can't say "Phi Tau, they're
            all jocks" or "Phi Tau, they only care about school". We do a little bit of everything and
            do it well. We have Brothers from all over the nation and from all different majors, races,

            want something simpler, ask any one of us to see the Hole in the Wall DVD - watching that

          <p>The leadership experience you receive when in a fraternity is invaluable. Although we do know
            how to have fun, we also know how to get work done. Time management is crucial to your
            college career and Phi Kappa Tau can assist you in this. The ability to balance academics,
            social life, philanthropy, and sleep in order to get the most out of your college experience
            is the single greatest gift Phi Kappa Tau can give you. However, this is not the only way in
            which Phi Tau prepares its members. It is no coincidence that so many Phi Taus end up with
            rewarding jobs; the people you meet and the connections you form make it easier to find
            better co-ops while in school and better jobs after graduation. In addition, the social
            skills you develop provide you with the required skills for job interviews and meeting
            people.</p>

          <p>Academics come first in Phi Tau. We have members in just about every major at RIT. For example, if you are an
            Electrical Engineering major, we have older Electrical Engineering majors that can help you study. They have
            taken the classes you will take. They have had the professors you will have. They know about co-ops.
            They know about finals. They know the ins and outs to the 10-week quarter system.
            We teach each other here and that is priceless. When you apply for a job, being a Phi Tau
            can work to your advantage. Your social experience has prepared you for your job interview.
            Your GPA and other academic achievements will be excellent because of our focus on scholarship.
            You will have been involved in philanthropy and community service, which is a crucial part of job
            placement. We have Phi Taus involved at RIT that can provide excellent letters of recommendation.
            And finally, we know lots of people all over the nation - Phi Taus like to hire other Phi Taus!

          <p>Ranking Phi Kappa Tau, or any fraternity for that matter, depends on any number of
            variables. Typically, the question begs to the issue of how many chapters the organization
            has and/or how many alumni are on the record books with good addresses. There are presently
            66 men's social fraternities that are members of the North-American Inter fraternity
            Conference. In terms of numbers of active chapters and total living alumni, Phi Kappa Tau
            ranks in the top 25 of the NIC member groups.</p>

            2 Parents Fund Scholarships for $1,000 each
            3 Inter fraternity Educational Fellowships for $2,000 each

            As the cost of education rises, more scholarships and scholarships in larger amounts will be

            If you think you fit in at our house then you may be Phi Tau material and we would love to

          <p>Dues are $450 a semester. At first glance, that may seem like a lot, but when we break it

            our National Organization. If anything happens to any of us while with the fraternity, we are
            covered. Some of the money funds our events. When we have dinners every other week or social
            events with sororities, we don't charge for attendance. You can think of it as prepaying for
            your weekend activities. The rest of the money goes towards items that are beneficial for the
            entire house, such as furniture, TVs, paper towels, and Brotherhood dinners.</p>

            Philanthropic efforts - The opportunities available through Phi Tau's involvement with the

          <p>Fraternity and Sorority Alumni are much more likely than nonmembers to participate in community service activities after graduation
            Forty-three of the 100 members of the U.S. Senate are members of a fraternity or sorority
            29% of the U.S. House of Representatives are Greek affiliated
            Of North America's 50 largest corporations, 43 are headed by Greek men and women
            7 out of 10 people listed in "Who's Who?" are Greek
            85% of Fortune 500 executives are Greek
            40 of 47 U.S. Supreme Court Justices are Greek
            All but two Presidents and two Vice-Presidents, born after the founding of the first social fraternity in 1825, were fraternity members
            63% of all U.S. Cabinet members since 1900 have been Greek
            All of the Apollo 11 astronauts were Greek
            Only 2% of the population are members of Greek organizations
            A U.S. Government study shows that over 70% of Greeks graduate, while under 50% of non-Greeks graduate
            A study by the University of Missouri found that Greeks throughout the US and Canada are more involved on their campuses and rate their overall university experience better
            The same Missouri study found Greeks are more financially successful after they graduate than independents, are more involved in their communities, and give more generously to their alma matters
            Greeks not only participate in their own fraternity or sorority leadership, but are also involved in the same extracurricular activities as non affiliated students
            As undergraduates, Greeks raise approximately $7 million per year for charities
            As undergraduates, Greeks give approximately 850,000 volunteer hours per year
            Greek alumni are more satisfied with the social and cultural aspects of the college experience than non affiliated students
            Greek affiliation has a significant impact on the current income of alumni
            Employers consider 18 key factors in evaluating job interviews...the Greek community provides opportunity to develop 12 of those key factors: Real-World Experience, Leadership Qualities, Personal Presentation, Attitude, Communication Skills, Problem Solving, Community Service Orientation, Adaptability-Drive-Initiative, Proven Track Record, Ability to Learn, Preparation for Interviews
