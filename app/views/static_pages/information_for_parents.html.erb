Your son’s decision to join Phi Kappa Tau begins a lifelong experience, and we are pleased that he is a part of our circle. Our Fraternity is grounded in timeless values and principles, and as an organization, we challenge our members to set the standard for leadership, service and scholarship in the greek community.

Phi Kappa Tau members make a difference on their campuses and in their communities because of the wonderful support they receive from their parents. A parent’s job never stops, and we know how important it is to stay involved in your son’s choices and experiences. We invite you to be part of your son’s fraternity experience—even if it just means that you ask questions or consider a volunteer opportunity. We know our mission is a team effort.

Fraternity life, when focused properly, is very much about brotherhood, leadership development, fun, and positive experiences that will add value and enhance the academic experience. On behalf of all our members, we are proud that your son is a part of our brotherhood, and we hope he will always take advantage of all that Phi Kappa Tau has to offer.
